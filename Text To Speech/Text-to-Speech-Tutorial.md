# Watson Text to Speech tutorial

The IBM Watson Text to Speech Service is a cloud service that lets you convert written text into natural-sounding audio in various languages and voices within an existing application or within Watson Assistant. Watson Text to Speech enables fast and accurate speech transcription in multiple languages for various use cases, including customer self-service apps that:

* Build a mobile to-do app that captures voice memos to save as written to-do items
* Use as a simple ready-to-use model to capture English voices without any customization
* Use as a lightweight feature that can be invoked from the constrained mobile device
