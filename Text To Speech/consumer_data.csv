14,2022-03-07,"I have been disputing fraud accounts on my credit report since XX/XX/XXXX. I keep sending multiple sets of letters to the bureaus so the excuse of "" we didn't get it '' doesn't happen. Furthermore, each letter is signed and attached with an FTC and Identity Theft affidavit, yet the bureaus are still not taking any actions. The accounts are not showing in dispute nor are they removed from my report. The bureaus seem to ignore the trend and let these fraud accounts affect my credit score. I have requested the investigation to be initiated and also verifiable proof to be submitted should the accounts claim to be mine. Not only have I not received any mail showing the verifiable proof needed to justify the items to be on my report, I haven't even received any letters at all stating the investigations have begun. Per the FCRA and federal law, the process is supposed to be 30 days. 250 days later, I'm still here shelling out money with no end in sight and no results to show. I have had ENOUGH! HOW MUCH DOCUMENTATION does it take to get SOMEONE to REALLY DO SOMETHING?? LOOK at the attachments! THIS IS NOT ROCKET SCIENCE! You asked for Documentation and I have given it. AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN! THE DISCHARGE PAPER FROM THE COURT IS CLEAR! THEY CAN NOT COLLECT on a DISCHARGED DEBT!! This is my last option before I take this up with my lawyers and sue for full compensation and damages incurred. Please delete the accounts immediately!

16,2022-03-21,"Beginning in XXXX of XXXX I reached out to Midland Credit to request information pertaining to a debt showing on my credit report that I did not recognize. I requested information and validation of the debt and did not receive any information or correspondents. I sent multiple letters and did not receive any of the requested information. 

In XXXX of XXXX I started receiving court paper and learned that i was being sued for an account I had no knowledge of. 

The Lawyer of XXXX XXXX provided me with a little information pertaining and advise me to speak with the lawyer that actually has my case as he was just feeling in. 

I attempted to reach out to the lawyer with no success. I received documents on XX/XX/XXXX and immediately called the number listed as there were multiple discrepancies with the information listed. The number listed was for Midland credit directly instead of the lawyer. The midland rep stated that she would have the lawyer contact me after we both found some discrepancies as well as Midland shows all my letters that were set to them. 

I have never applied for a credit card account with XXXX bank. The information they have including the credit cards and bill was sent to my old address on XXXX in XXXX in XXXX. I moved from that address in XXXX. 

This debt does not belong to me and was opened without my knowledge and authorization. 

Attached are additional documents for review"
20,2022-03-06,"On XX/XX/XXXX I was called by TD Bank ( XXXX ) XXXX which is an accurate phone number for the bank. I was told that there was suspected fraud on my account and they needed to confirm some of my transactions on my checking account. He asked for the last 4 of my SS # which I provided as this is commonly requested to verify my identity. He then proceeded to recite transactions in my account. Some were valid and some weren't. That is when he started what he referred to as initiating a fraud claim. He provided me with a fraud claim # as well. At this time he told me he needed to send me a account confirmation code to my cell phone as well. When I called TD bank the next day to check on the status of the fraud situation, since I received an email that I had insufficient funds in my account, I was told that they never called me and that someone must've spoofed their phone number to make it look like it was TD bank. At this point I realize that someone presenting themselves as a TD bank rep, fraudulently induced me into supplying the last 4 of my SS # and other information to obtain access to my account. This person obviously stoIe my identity by logging into my account and transferring my money around under the pretense that they were a TD bank representative. I learned from the branch that someone logged in, transferred money from my savings account to my checking account and then sent all of the checking account money by EFT to a XXXX payment. I have never heard of XXXX, never used or set up an account with XXXX and also never opted in with TD bank to be a part of XXXX at all. Both my saving and checking accounts were cleared out. I was instructed to obtain a police report which I did get. How was my user name and password obtained? This is actually the XXXX time with TD bank that I have had fraudulent activity. The first time was unauthorized charges. This time is obviously much worse since my account was cleared out of a total of {$2200.00}. Does TD bank not monitor the location of where someone is logging in from? if so, they would see it was not my usual location. Also, as for XXXX, if I never used their service before and then they suddenly see a payment being sent by someone not enrolled in their service, doesn't that flag something on their end? My last question is shouldn't TD bank and all banks ask you to opt in to XXXX? I find it quite dangerous that if someone gets access to my online information again that they can just sent my money anywhere they want. TD bank is in the process of their XXXX day investigation but I wanted to report this fraudulent inducing incident directly. TD bank is saying that I have a XX/XX/XXXX chance of getting my money back and from what I see, within the laws, they are liable to return my funds. XXXX XXXX of the XXXX XXXX Police Dept ( XXXX XXXX, NY ) provided a Central Complaint # XXXX and said my "" identity theft report '' will be ready in 3 to 5 days."

2. Equifax Information Services, LLC chose to continue to harass me and refuse to delete inaccurate information from my consumer file and consumer reports, and refused to provide full 609 disclosures as I have requested more than once. 
3. Equifax Information Services, LLC has chosen to respond by requesting my ID and utility bill that I already sent them back on XX/XX/2021. 

These are just stall tactics. I am being continuously damaged by Equifax Information Services , LLC and their violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

They are reporting and including information in my consumer file of entities that do not exist.

32,2022-03-12,"Over the course of 30 days I have filed a dispute in regards to inaccurate and false information on my credit report. Ive attached a copy of my dispute mailed in certified to Equifax and they are still reporting these incorrect items. According to the fair credit ACT, section 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ) they are required by Federal Law to only report Accurate information and the have not done so. They have not provided me with any proof i.e. and original consumer contract with my signature on it proving that this is my account.

Further more, I would like to make a formal complaint that Ive tried calling Equifax Over 10 times this week and every single time Ive called Ive asked for a representative in the fraud dispute department wants transfer it over there when you speak to the representative and let them know that you are looking to dispute inquiries and accounts due to fraud they immediately transfer you to their survey line essentially ending the call. I believe Equifax is training their representatives to not help consumers over the phone and performing unethical practices. 

Once I finally got a hold of a representative she told me that she could not help because I did not send in my Social Security card which violates my consumer rights. So Im Making a formal CFPB complaint that you will correct Equifaxs actions.

43,2022-05-16,"I AM A NATURAL PERSON & CONSUMER FILING THIS COMPLAINT. 
DO NOT CLOSE THIS COMPLAINT STATING THIS IS NOT ME! 

The tradeline being reported has a derogatory rating which has caused me serious financial and emotional distress. This has caused defamation to my creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics. 

In order to rectify this situation and ensure my rights have not been violated in any way, I have sent multiple letters and complaints challenging the completeness, accuracy and integrity of the information XXXX is furnishing.

This notification is required under the FCRA, section 623, subsection ( 7 ) ( A ). However, I never received documentation that XXXX complied with this requirement."
44,2022-03-07,"To Whom It May Concern, Please be advised that I have received your computer-generated letter stating that you have ceased investigation of my credit reports because, in your opinion, you believe that I have used a third-party credit repair agency. Not only do I believe this to be a stall tactic on your part to grant you an additional 30 days to comply with my original request, but I believe it to be a blatant violation of the FCRA. 

You were advised by me on XX/XX/2022 by certified mail that I questioned the accuracy of a few items on my credit reports. That request was written by me and mailed by me- not a third-party agency. It appears obvious to me that you are abusing your power under the FCRA to escape a complete investigation. 

Here again is the incorrect information being reported : 1. Under 15 USC 1666B this is a billing error always paid as agreed on time this is an error this account in violation. 
XXXX XXXX Account Number : XXXX THIS ACCOUNT IS INACCURATE, I DID NOT INCUR ANY LATE PAYMENTS. PLEASE UPDATE TO PAID ON TIME Additionally, there is NO law that states a consumer can not use a third party, so using that as your excuse is an irrelevant. In fact, the United States Congress has found the whole process so overwhelming that they afford consumers the right to use a third party on their behalf if the consumer so chooses. This is why your statement is so shameful. 

I reserve the right to sue a credit bureau for violations of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and I believe I can prove that you did not use reasonable measures to ensure the accuracy of my credit reports and now you are stalling the process even further. 

I realize disputes can be expensive and it is your job to stall them, but you do so at great risk. Please take notice that this letter dated XX/XX/2022 is formal notice to you that I am requesting that you continue forward with my original investigation request and please send the results to me within 15 days. I therefore legally and lawfully refuse your "" form letter '' thus giving you only 15 days not 30 more. 

I am annoyed and outraged at your accusation and I have researched my rights in regards to my credit file. Please expedite my original request immediately."
49,2022-05-18,"This is the original message that was sent with first complaint. Then the complaint was closed with company providing not correct information and not replying to my complaint. 

"" I have made a purchase but after 3.5 weeks, this purchase was returned. Before making a payment, I waited until the refund was posted and by the time refund posted, credit card company posted a late fee and interest charge. I have contacted them and explained what happened, they have removed the late fee and said they will remove the interest charge but they never did. The interest charge was {$21.00}. After contacting them again, they told me they refunded the interest charge but it was only {$0.00}. I told them the amount was incorrect, however I was told they refunded full amount of interest charge. It takes them 3-5 business days to reply, and by the time I was dealing with this issue, they charged me additional {$18.00} interest charge because I did not pay my bill in full. I tried contacting them, with no help. They told me they will keep adding additional interest until I pay my account in full. I owed nothing on my account except that {$21.00} interest charge and now it's up to {$40.00}. They will not work with me to resolve this issue. '' Here 's the response from the company : "" The account terms are explained in the Credit Card Agreement. When payments aren't received, are made for less than the minimum required, or are received after the due date cutoff time, we'll assess a late fee to the account. In addition, we'll assess a finance charge or minimum interest charge any time the full balance in the regular revolving credit plan is not paid by the payment due date. On XX/XX/2022, we applied a courtesy late fee credit of {$30.00} along with the associated finance charge of {$0.00}. '' My feedback to that response. 
I have stated that you have refunded the late fee, and I am grateful for that, however when you said you refunded the finance charge, it was only {$0.00} and not {$21.00}. If you would have refunded the correct amount, I wouldn't be here, and while we were trying to resolve this, you have charged me additional {$18.00} interest, because I did not pay the initial interest charge. You knew we are trying to resolve this, why would you purposefully charge me additional interested on top of the previous interest? 
I also closed my account over a month ago."
50,2022-04-13,I have been in dispute with Equifax for almost a year about these fraudulent disputes inquires. They have lied numerous times about receiving my documents when they have received them. The FTC reports are attached to this email. So it's no excuse that they can't remove these inquiries

52,2022-03-14,"Hello, We bought and closed our house on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  through a conventional mortgage via Mortgage company : Dovenmuehle Mortgage , Inc . Address : XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, IL XXXX. 

Our monthly payments also included PMI ( mortgage insurance ). Over the last few months, we have made additional payments towards the principal to bring down our outstanding balance to 75.06 % of loan to value ( LTV ). In addition, the monthly payments have been on time with no delinquencies. In the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I called and requested cancellation of PMI. 

The XXXX tax form 1098 issued to me clearly states, "" If you are current on your loan payments, PMI will automatically terminate on the date the principal balance of your loan is first scheduled to reach 78 % of the original value of the property ''. 

I received a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX stating that I meet the requirements, however I must order a new appraisal which would cost me about {$750.00}. I called the company on XX/XX/XXXX, they said these are based on rules by HUD ( Housing and Urban Development ) and transferred me to them. HUD however states they only deal with FHA loans and not conventional loans. Dovenmuehle continues to give me the run around making me pay {$75.00} per month for PMI. 

It has been less than 6 months since the initial appraisal, it does not make any sense on why should we waste money on another appraisal. Also, the company refuses to tell me at what LTV will they automatically cancel the PMI without requiring another appraisal. 

This is clearly a case of exploitation of the consumer. Please help! 

Thank you!"
55,2016-05-18,I ended my lease with Infiniti XX/XX/2016 through a trade into XXXX. XXXX paid off my final 4 payments and disposition fee for a total of {$2000.00} on XXXX/XXXX/2016. This included 4 payments@XXXX for XXXX - XXXX 2016 and a disposition fee of {$390.00}. I had ACH on this loan and additional payments drafted on XXXX & XXXX as I did not cancel the ACH to avoid any potential credit issues if XXXX did XXXX close my lease on time. I contacted Infiniti in XXXX to see what the hold up was with ending my lease and to seek a refund for the 2 additional payments tha were drafted after the time of XXXX being paid off by XXXX. I was told I needed to remit a final odomometer reading statement to close out my account. This was faxed on XXXX/XXXX/16 & XXXX/XXXX/16. I called several other times within XXXX to XXXX to seek my refund and was advised that it could take XXXX weeks to generate an end of lease lyability statement. I once again called XX/XX/XXXX to seek the refund and was advised that the end of lease statement will be expedited to a Manager as it should have generated by now and I was assured it would be completed by XXXX XXXX. I call again on XXXX XXXX as no such letter has yet been generated. I spoke with another Manager who advised they will seek my refund and try to expedite the letter. As of XX/XX/XXXX still no letter available and no refund received. I was assured by the Manager that they will call me back with an update on XXXX and no call was received. The car was returned over 3 months ago and yet I still do not have a refund for my 2 payments that were overpaid as well as anything else that Infiniti may owe me. Please look into this and help me obtain my refund plus any additional recourse tat I may have against Infiniti. I was a loyal customer of Infiniti for over 10 years and leased XXXX vehicles through them and would have expected to be treated more fair.

59,2022-03-17,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I went into online banking to submit a payment for my capital one card. Somehow they received the incorrect account number that is completely different from my account information that has been on file for auto pay for the last few years. I also submitted a payment on my wife 's menards capital one card the same day which has a completely separate login and set up a payment on that account as well. My bank called my informing me that they were going to return those payments as they were seeing an invalid account #. I understood this and they said they were going to send those payments back to Capital One. Both payments returned on XX/XX/2022. 

My Wifes Capital One Card Menards card ( I am an authorised user ) : On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a payment on my wife 's capital on card and updated the bank account to make sure I entered the correct information. On XX/XX/XXXX, that payment came back as invalid account again even though I submitted the correct bank account information.On XX/XX/XXXX I called capital one and let them know what was going on and at this point they were reporting past due on our credit. I understood there was a process to take to try and resolve the matter so I set up a payment with them over the phone so that there would be a recording with the correct bank information. They were informing me that I was submitting the wrong information online. This payment also came back on invalid account on XX/XX/XXXX. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have received late charges, interest charges and was reporting over 30 days past due. 

My Capital One Cards : I was originally set up for recurring ach on both of my capital one cards. The {$300.00} that I set up on XX/XX/XXXX was an additional payment and would have been just a principal payment. I was under the assumption that I was still on auto pay with my bank account that I have been used for the past 3 years. They cancelled my auto pay with both my capital one cards that I anticipated would go through on XX/XX/2022. I didn't know they cancelled the auto pay. On XX/XX/XXXX I set up a payment for {$81.00} with them on the phone verbally for one of my cards and a set up a payment with there website with the other card for {$140.00} to withdrawal on XX/XX/2022 with my account that I have on file which is my correct bank account. On XX/XX/XXXX the {$81.00} was returned. On XX/XX/XXXX the {$140.00} was returned. I have received late charges, and interest charges on these accounts. Some late charges have been waived but not all charges have been waived. 

Important Conversations1 : 2 hour phone call. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with multiple representatives. First in regards to my XXXX capital one cards, in which they had me set up payments for one of the cards. The amount for that card wa {$890.00}. They then needed to transfer me to a Senior Account Specialist for my wifes card. The representative was looking into why the payments were coming back. He had to do a zoom with someone and put me on hold. He came back on the line and informed me that they had flagged my bank account as an invalid account and that I needed my bank to send a fax to them in order for me to be able use my bank account with them. I did a XXXX way call with my bank on the line and my bank took down the information to fax to and sent it right away. The representative from capital one let me know that the payments that I had set up after XX/XX/XXXX including the payments that I had set up earlier on the same call would come back as invalid until they unflagged the account. There was nothing I could do about the payment that I had set up on my capital one card earlier as it was already in process. I was told that it could take up to 14 days for them to validate my bank account and to just check back in sometime to see if I could use my bank account again. They provided no follow up call or who I should call. I received notification vial email from capital one on XX/XX/2022 stating that I had a document ready for viewing. I opened up the document and downloaded it. It stated that they verified my bank account information was valid and I could start using the account again. 

Important Conversation 2 : I called Capital One on XX/XX/2022, spoke with someone about my cards, he had no idea as to any issue with the cards. I provided him with my investigation number that was on the letter and he sent me to a Senior Account Manager XXXX. XXXX researched my account and only recognized an investigation on 1 of my cards not on my other card or my wifes card. I had to repeat all information. XXXX confirmed that my bank account that was a valid bank account was flagged and shouldn't have been, however now according to her records my bank was sending the payments bank even though they were providing the correct information. I informed her that was not correct. I actually received documentation from my bank account with the account # they are sending to my bank and it is incorrect even though I provided them with the correct #. She said because this is not their error ( although it really is ) they can't do anything about it. I stated, you removed my bank account that was set up on recurring payments and flagged an account that was a good bank account as an invalid account. She confirmed that and stated that should not have happened and apologized but they couldn ; t do anything about it. She stated that I needed to get my bank back on the line to confirm the bank account information when sending to them was correct. I let her know that I would be able to get my bank on the line to do this on XX/XX/2022 at noon. I set up 3 payments with capital one verbally for all 3 accounts since I got the letter stating I could use my bank account again. I checked my bank account and all 3 payments had gone through. 

Important Conversation 3 : Capital one called and got my bank on a 3 way call. We verified the information coming to my bank was different then the information provided from capital one. Capital one claimed they are sending information with the correct account and my bank is telling them that they are sending a different account number. They ask if my bank did a merger, my bank says no. They conclude without any resolution. I confirm with capital one that I provided the correct account information. They stated that was correct. I confirmed again that they flagged my correct account as an invalid account not allowing me to make payments with that account. They said yes that is correct. I confirm that they are not going to work on the investigation further and not correct my credit bureau reporting past due or waive any fees. They said yes. They recommend me to send a letter to their credit dispute department and provided me with an address to send it to. I am unable to call or email this information. I take down the information and am going to send a dispute for all 3 cards. I am also going to go directly to all 3 credit bureaus and dispute this information as well. There was no resolution on this call."

If the person specifies such an address, it may not furnish information relating to a consumer to any CRA, if ( a ) the consumer notified the person, at the specified address, that the information is inaccurate, and ( b ) the information is, in fact, inaccurate.18 If the person does not specify such an address, the FCRA prohibits the person from reporting information to a CRA if the furnisher knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate.19 The statute defines reasonable cause to believe that the information is inaccurate to mean having specific knowledge, other than solely allegations by the consumer, that would cause a reasonable person to have substantial doubts about the accuracy of the information.20 Duty to Implement Reasonable Policies and Procedures Regulation V requires furnishers to establish and implement reasonable written policies and procedures regarding the accuracy and integrity of the consumer information furnished to CRAs.33 Accuracy means that the information the furnisher provides to a CRA correctly : Identifies the appropriate consumer ; Reflects the accounts terms and liability ; and Reflects the consumers performance with respect to the account.34 Integrity means the information the furnisher provides to a CRA : Is substantiated by the furnishers records at the time it is furnished ; Is in a form designed to minimize the likelihood that the information may be incorrectly reflected in a consumer report ; Includes the information in the furnishers possession regarding the credit limit, if applicable ; and Includes any other information in the furnishers possession that the Bureau has determined the absence of which would likely be materially misleading in evaluating a consumers creditworthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, general reputation, personal characteristics, or mode of living.35"

Not knowing our funds were frozen, we previously submitted checks to pay bills a few days before I called the bank. As a result, we were charged return check fees on all of our checks by the merchant. 
We were not notified and had no knowledge that our payments would not be honored.. We should not be responsible for the returned check fees and US Bank should pay them. The bank told me "" they do not pay merchant fees ''. 
Also. because of our "" late '' payments, our excellent credit score is now deteriorated through no fault of our own.I called to inquire why our account was being closed, I was not given an answer... only saying 'it was under review '' We did not have a negative balance."

68,2022-03-12,"Hi, I was scammed a few years ago by someone online. It really hurt me mentally and financially. I actually went into a heavy XXXX. I was scammed by someone online in a gift card scam. The XXXX XXXX credit card was used for this scam. I am unable to access the account anymore. The company should still have my data and be able to see all my purchases. They are gift cards that I would have never bought for myself or anyone else. I was fooled and scammed into buying them. I am admitting that I was the one who bought those cards, but they were not used by me. I was a puppet for that person. He tricked me into buying those cards for him and he redeemed all of them digitally. I think they were XXXX  cards. It's been a few years, so I don't remember which company gift cards and the exact dates I got them. The bank statements should show those purchases and I might also have some useful pics, but not a guarantee to find them. 

I tried to talk with the bankers and told them about what happened. They said they will investigate and get back to me on it. No one got back to me and it's been over a year now! 

This has been hurting my credit score every month for so long. It's stopping me from being approved for a lot of things because my credit barely goes up. 

I will really appreciate it if you guys can help me with this, please."

Only one payment went through ( XXXX ), so I disputed the payment ending in XXXX There was even a three way conference with a XXXX rep and a B of A Soup so that there were no misunderstandings and some how B of A still managed to dispute the wrong payment. They disputed the payment ending in XXXX. Because of this mistake my XXXX account was cancelled on XX/XX/2017. Now XXXX wants more than the returned payment in order to reactivate the account in addition to the reactivation fees and prorated that will generate on the next bill. When I explained this matter to a claims rep he notated the account stating I would need help with the prorated charges and reactivation fees that would generate. I talked to another rep from the bank and she told me to fax proof of the amount XXXX needed in order to reactivate the account. I got the tangible info needed and sent a fax over to the claims specialist as instructed. I called a few days later to check the status of my claim in regards to reactivating, and he told me that b of a would not be paying me for anything but the returned payment not the result of their mistake. Right now XXXX XXXX is asking for XXXX in order to reactivate because the was a balance coming due XX/XX/XXXX of about XXXX. If this matter lingers ill be billed for the XXXX worth of equipment that I'm currently financing, I also lost monthly discounts such as free tablets and a discounted XXXX  that will become full price when the account is reactivated. I also had a grandfathered plan that was forfeited and will have to face a monthly increase of about XXXX dollars a month in order to get the features that I had before the account was cancelled. I want compensation for the entire account and the difference that I had to pay after losing my employee discount.
